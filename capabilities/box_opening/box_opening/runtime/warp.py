"""Non-uniform time warping of a planned trajectory.

Every leg today executes under ONE speed scale (retime.py's exact time
dilation), so a guarded descent crawls at contact speed for its whole
length — `grip:down` spent 4.16 s covering 118 mm when only the last
centimetres are near anything. A person moves briskly and *decelerates
into* contact; that is most of what "not robotic" means here.

This module retimes a trajectory so it runs fast through the free-air
portion and slows into the final stretch. Three properties make it safe:

  - POSITIONS ARE UNTOUCHED. The path the planner validated is the path
    executed; only the timestamps and the velocities that annotate them
    change. The sanity gate and the collision plan still hold.
  - IT ONLY EVER SLOWS relative to the plan. Every scale is <= 1.0, so no
    executed velocity exceeds one cuRobo already limit-checked, and the
    executor's own velocity and continuity checks pass by construction
    (a longer dt only widens the allowed step).
  - THE TRANSITION IS RAMPED. A step change in scale would put a velocity
    discontinuity mid-trajectory — the exact jerk this is meant to remove.

The caller pairs the returned `arm_frac` with GuardSpec.rebaseline_after
so the torque guard re-captures its baseline once the arm is in the slow
regime: the guard stays armed the whole way (coverage is not reduced),
but its reference is taken in the regime where contact will happen,
instead of carrying a fast-motion baseline into a slow touch.
