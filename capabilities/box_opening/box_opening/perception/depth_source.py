"""Container pose from depth: the box found by GEOMETRY, not by a print.

The fiducial path this replaced died twice at the bench in one week —
the gripper knuckles strike a printed tag on every press, and a 30 mm
print at scan height has almost no detection margin. This source needs
no print at all: from the scan pose the lid top is the only plateau at
container height above the MEASURED table. Aligned-depth pixels are
deprojected, lifted to base_link with frame-stamp TF (camera_pose_at),
banded by height, and the most box-like in-band blob whose footprint
matches the model becomes the sighting:

    plateau median z  = the lid top, MEASURED
    plateau centroid  = the button center (the button is centered),
                        refined to the button's CIRCLE when one is seen
    min-area-rect     = yaw, mod 90 deg — the box is square, and every
                        consumer is yaw-mod-90 invariant: button_offset
                        is purely vertical, press attitude is steered by
                        BEARING, and both collision cuboids are square

BoxTopWatcher ticks on a node timer (detection proceeds during every
spin the CLI does), commits through FixWindow's n-agreeing-fresh-frames
rule, and exposes fix()/status()/reset() to the mission. What this
source cannot do: tell one box from another (the VLM/OWL roi does that),
or see a box whose lid is off — fine here, the mission starts lid-on.
